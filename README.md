# Deep_dream_challenge
Using the demo from Siraj Raval, I wasen't happy with the image beeing modified little times so I made the image iterate more times in order to make it more abstract!

in the example the image under.jpg It doesn't change at all, but adding more iterations make it really awkard and cool :)


thanks Siraj Raval!
